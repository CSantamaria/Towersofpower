# Towersofpower

This is the final code that we developed for Benedetta Piantella's class, Towers of Power. 
It was a random, challenging, fun, awesome process and we're really excited about continuing to work on it and 
develop different uses for it. 

Code by Francisco Ramirez, Karthik Pajantali and Clara Santamaria. ITP - NYU, Spring 2015.
